## I'm Nick Swinford.

I'm a self-taught web developer. I started web development as a Joomla Integrator, but when available components for Joomla wouldn't suffice, I decided to learn to write my own. After learning enough PHP and HTML to be dangerous, I moved on to CSS, JavaScript, and eventually front-end frameworks like Ember.js and React. 

I've worked with jQuery, Ember.js, React, React Native, Joomla and Laravel. Constantly learning new technologies and deepening my understanding of languages.

- 👨‍💻 I love writing clean back-end code and beautiful front-end interfaces. 

- 🗺️ I live in Kentucky, but I'm originally from Chicago. Miss the concrete jungle and urban sprawl, but the mountains and foresets of Kentucky will always call to me.

- 🎓 I have a Bachelors of Science, Major in Biology, from Eastern Kentucky University. I've always loved science, but computer science and my love of web development won out.

- 🎮 I'm a gamer. My first game was Age of Empires. I'm a huge fan of strategy games, but also like shooters and and MMOs.

- 🏋️‍♂️ I love to weight lift. Started lifting about three years ago and loved it ever since. Something about picking up a realy heavy weight and putting it right back where it was just speaks to me.
